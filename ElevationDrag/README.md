Android ElevationDrag Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates a drag and drop action on different shapes. Elevation and
z-translation are used to render the shadows and the views are clipped using different
Outlines.

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates a drag and drop action on different shapes. Elevation and
z-translation are used to render the shadows and the views are clipped using different
Outlines.

Elevation is considered the static or initial position of a view on the z axis, while
translationZ exists for transient states, like animations.

`Z = elevation + translationZ`

See [Assign Elevation to Your Views][1] for more info.
